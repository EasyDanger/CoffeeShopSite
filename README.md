# CoffeeShopSite
Project to create a mock, but fully functional employee login site for a coffee shop with dubious motivation

This project was originally planned to be an employee login site allowing for employees to login and view menu items and the basic information of other employees.

The coffee shop may or may not be run by some sort of non-human entity, but that's not really important to the code.

This project was developed as a multi-part coding lab as part of the Grand Circus curriculum in the fall of 2018. It is a webapp that uses Spring MVC, Hibernate, and MySQL. It was developed on Windows 10 and tested in Opera 56. More recent, fully featured versions exist but have not yet been pulled to the master branch.
